I’m <span>Mahdi</span> , a 26 years old _self-taught_ <span>Front-end</span> developer.

After my university degree in _"Electronics Engineering"_ , I felt like the it is essential to learn programming languages so I decided to learn _C#_ after that I realized I'm much more into _web_ and _mobile applications_ development rather than programming hardwares.

So like anybody else I started learning fundamental of web development started with HTML and CSS and _Javascript_. In January 2019 I decided to take the risk and quit my job. I’ve been studying Front-end development full time ever since.

During this time, I took online courses like [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/) [The Complete Javascript Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course), [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/), [Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript), [ES6](https://es6.io), [Modern React w/ Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/), [React: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux), [Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM), read book series ["You don’t know JS"](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS), and also watched countless youtube videos about Javascript.

Because we know the best way to learn is to practice, I also did a bunch of personal projects with the knowledge I gathered from the courses, you can check them on my <scroll-link to='portfolio'>portfolio</scroll-link>.

I always want to _learn more_, _do more_, and _be more_. I’m also a firm believer that we should <span>never settle</span>.

I’m _hard working_, _super curious_, _passionate_, _committed_, and also a _fast learner_!
