<h3>1:  What is Gatsby?</h3>
Gatsby is a React-based, GraphQL powered static web website online generator. What does that even mean? Well, it weaves collectively the great elements of React, Webpack, react-router, GraphQL, and different front-stop equipment into at least one very exciting developer experience. Don’t get hung up at the moniker ‘static web website online generator’. That time period has been around for a while, however, Gatsby is some distance greater like a cutting-edge front-stop framework than a static web website online generator of old.

It uses powerful preconfiguration to build a website that uses only static files for incredibly fast page loads, service workers, code splitting, server-side rendering, intelligent image loading, asset optimization, and data prefetching. All out of the box. I didn’t believe the speed until I tried it myself.

You code and develop your site, Gatsby transforms it into a directory with a single HTML file and your static assets. This folder is uploaded to your favorite hosting provider, and voila. Overall think, part Jekyll, part create-react-app.

<h3>2: What makes Gatsby special?</h3>
you may be wondering, “i've a nice net percent config i exploit”, or “create-react-app works for me”, or "Jekyll is pleasant for my weblog.”  properly, I suppose there are three things that make Gatsby very unique versus those other tools.

First, is the way Gatsby makes use of GraphQL to build it’s statistics layer. What do I mean with the aid of that? Gatsby is made to collect your statistics from anywhere it is able to be: Markdown, JSON, your favored CMS, 1/3 birthday celebration APIs, anywhere! And at build time, it creates an inner GraphQL server of all of this records. So to your react additives, all of your facts is queried at construct time from that equal vicinity, in the identical manner thru GraphQL.

the second one reason it’s unique is the richness of the Gatsby environment. Gatsby has no longer been round for too lengthy, however already boasts great documentation, and a number of starters that will help you get a domain up quickly.  That GraphQL statistics collection I noted earlier than may additionally sound intimidating, however due to Gatsby's properly-documented information supply plugins, it could be as simple as a few strains of code within the config document.

ultimately, is its determination to performance. each component of overall performance and accessibility is a factor of emphasis, and you may really experience that in the very last product.  more so than any boilerplate or generator i have come across, Gatsby lives as much as the hype.

<h3>3:Do I have to recognize React and GraphQL?</h3>
one of the largest hurdles to someone trying out Gatsby is announcing, “well, I don’t know GraphQL”, or “I don’t recognize React and that i truely don’t have the time or electricity to learn those in order that i can attempt Gatsby.”  truthful enough, and as someone who knew React, however was intimidated by way of GraphQL, I take away mastering Gatsby for way too lengthy after first listening to approximately it.  however, i will with a bit of luck say that if you only realize one or don’t recognize either of React and GraphQL, Gatsby is surely a splendid point of entry.  It has exquisite documentation and examples of React and GraphQL, and its shape lends itself to ‘wondering in React’ and ‘thinking in GraphQL’.

Now, as some distance as, can you use Gatsby with out those?  I actually attempted it.  As I referred to, I knew React, however now not GraphQL, and concept, I’ll simply not use the GraphQL element, you realize just make regular API calls in my additives, and so forth.  Don’t try this.  It misses the purpose of Gatsby completely, and hamstrings you absolutely.  kind of like saying, “can i use React with out JSX?”

So, yes, React and GraphQL are crucial for Gatsby, but if you don’t recognise them, Gatsby is an awesome device to study them, and not an excuse no longer to.
